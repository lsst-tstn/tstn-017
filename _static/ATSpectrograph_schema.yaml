properties:
  instrument_port:
    description: The port on which the instrument mounted on the telescope
    type: number

    description: IP of the controller
    type: string
    default: 1.0.0.127
  port:
    decription: Port for the controller
    type: integer
    default: 21
  min_pos:
    decription: Minimum position for the linear stage (in mm).
    type: number
    default: 0
  max_pos:
    decription: Maximum position for the linear stage (in mm).
    type: number
    default: 65
  tolerance:
    decription: Tolerance for positioning the linear stage.

      central_wavelength_filter:
        description: >
          Wavelength for which optical system will be opimized in units of nm. Approximations are sufficient as the
          focus dependence on wavelength is weak.
        type: array
        items:
          type: number
        default: [700, 700, 700, 700]

      offset_focus_filter:
        description: >
          Focus offset to be applied on the secondary mirror in units of um, relative to no glass being installed.
          Positive values push the secondary down and increase the back focal distance, therefore adding glass
          thickness will result in positive focus offsets.
        type: array
        uniqueItems: false

          type: number

      offset_pointing_filter:
        description: >
          Pointing offset to be applied to the telescope in units of arcseconds, relative to no glass being installed.
          Relative to the center of the detector, positive Y-values result in the star moving up an amplifier,
          positive X-values result in moving along rows, to higher pixel values.
